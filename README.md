# Utopian-Mess

#What is Utopian mess?

As students staying in hostels, we would all have come across the many problems associated with mess food. Most of us, skip many meals in 
the mess (courtesy, the amazing food there :P) and eat elsewhere. Now, not only does this lead to a huge wastage of food in the mess due to
the preparation of excess food, but it also leads to us losing money, having to pay the entire mess fee and for the food, we have outside/
night canteen. 

This project would require the mess to put up the menu  one day in advance . Students can then send a response if they will be eating the 
meal or not . This would give a rough estimate of how many people are attending and accordingly food can be prepared. This would minimize 
the wastage of food. 
Moreover, we also aim to keep a track of the meals a particular student has had throughout the semester and the student will have to pay 
the fees only for that amount at the end of the semester. This would let the students eat wherever they wish without any regrets of paying
for something they didn't eat.

In a nutshell, the app keeps track of how many people are eating in the mess so that the food in the mess does not go to waste and also 
keeps track of the number of meals a certain individual has eaten at the mess so that the total fee is actually proportional to how much 
the student ate there.
